# UK AI Transparency Framework

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the UK AI Transparency Framework!  
This project empowers organizations and government bodies to record, explain, and visualize automated decision-making processes using blockchain technology and natural language processing (NLP). The framework is designed to foster transparency, accountability, and trust in AI-driven decisions, especially those affecting citizens.

---

## 2. Framework Overview

The framework provides:
- **Immutable Blockchain Ledger**: Every automated decision is recorded as a block, ensuring a tamper-proof audit trail.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly web interface (built with Streamlit) for exploring decisions, visualizing trends, and managing data.
- **NLP Analyzer**: Automatically generates human-readable explanations for AI decisions, making complex logic accessible to all users.
- **Multi-Blockchain Support**: Easily adaptable to various blockchain backends for different organizational needs.

All components are tightly integrated, so users can seamlessly move from data entry to explanation, visualization, and audit.

## 3. User Experience

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. **Set Up the Environment**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```powershell
     .\.venv311\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     pip install -r uk-ai-transparency/requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Dashboard**
   ```powershell
   streamlit run uk-ai-transparency/src/transparency_dashboard.py
   ```
   - Open the provided local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

### Dashboard Features

- **UK Flag & Title**: At the top, you’ll see the UK flag and project title for instant recognition.
- **Tabs**:
  - **Dashboard**: View key metrics (total blocks, departments, algorithms) and interactive charts.
  - **Blockchain**: Explore the full, immutable record of all decisions.
  - **Explanations**: See NLP-generated explanations for each decision.
  - **New Decision**: Add a new automated decision to the system.

#### Step-by-Step Usage

- **Viewing Data**: Click the "Dashboard" tab for an overview, or "Blockchain" to see each decision’s details.
- **Adding a Decision**: Go to "New Decision", fill in the form (department, algorithm, decision text, impact level), and submit.
- **Getting Explanations**: In the "Explanations" tab, select a decision to see a plain-language explanation generated by the NLP analyzer.
- **Resetting the Blockchain**: Use the sidebar’s "Reset Blockchain" button to clear and restart the ledger (for demo/testing).

All actions are designed to be intuitive, with helpful messages and visual feedback.

## 4. NLP Analyzer

The NLP Analyzer automatically interprets and explains each decision:

- **How to Use**:  
  Explanations are generated automatically for every decision you add or view.  
  For advanced users, you can run the NLP analyzer directly via:
  ```python
  from nlp_explainer import NLPExplainer
  explainer = NLPExplainer()
  explanation = explainer.explain_decision({
      'decision': 'Approved housing benefit for citizen 12345',
      'algorithm': 'eligibility-check',
      'department': 'DWP'
  })
  print(explanation['explanation'])
  ```

- **Types of Decisions**:  
  The analyzer works with decisions related to risk assessment, eligibility checks, fraud detection, and more.  
  It extracts key factors and actions, helping users understand why a decision was made.

- **Decision-Making**:  
  Use the explanations to:
  - Communicate decisions to stakeholders or citizens.
  - Audit and review AI-driven processes.
  - Identify trends or issues in automated decision-making.

## 5. Blockchain Integration

- **Accessing Blockchain Features**:  
  All decisions are stored as blocks in an immutable chain.  
  Use the "Blockchain" tab to:
  - View each block’s data, hash, and previous hash.
  - Validate the integrity of the chain.

- **Example Use Cases**:
  - **Government**: Record benefit approvals, planning permissions, or medical recommendations.
  - **Enterprise**: Log automated compliance checks or resource allocations.
  - **Audit**: Prove that no decision has been tampered with after recording.

- **Multi-Blockchain Support**:  
  The framework is designed to be extensible. You can adapt the backend to different blockchain technologies as needed.

## 6. Benefits of Using the Dashboard

- **Transparency**: Every decision is recorded and explained, building trust with users and stakeholders.
- **Accountability**: Immutable records ensure that all actions are auditable.
- **Clarity**: NLP explanations make complex AI logic understandable for non-technical users.
- **Efficiency**: Quickly add, review, and analyze decisions in one place.
- **Insight**: Visualizations and metrics help identify patterns, risks, and opportunities for improvement.

**Potential Outcomes:**
- Improved public trust in AI systems.
- Faster, more reliable audits.
- Better communication between technical and non-technical teams.
