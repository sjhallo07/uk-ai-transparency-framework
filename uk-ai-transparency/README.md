# 🇬🇧 UK AI Transparency Framework

An immutable blockchain system for tracking and explaining UK government automated decisions with NLP-powered transparency.
I am making this contribution to show that I want to use the unconditional firm that was approved for me; I need to find a sponsor.
This is just a demo, but very soon I will make it for REAL use with very few resources using different types of APIs and libraries to collect data, and most importantly, in a very ethical way using the best practices like Robots.txt and training algorithms with supervised and unsupervised learning and auto-scalable what I intend to demonstrate with this is efficiency with few resources without using expensive equipment, a computer with 4GB of RAM, since this project will be developed using free resources, showing efficiency and lower public spending  autor Marcos Mora unconditional firm of heriot-watt university Msc computer cience
